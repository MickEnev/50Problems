## 50 JavaScript Coding Challenges
This is a collection of 50 JavaScript coding challenges. They start of very simple and progress to be slightly more challenging. The aim of this repository is to get a little more familiar with JavaScript and to have a bit of fun. This is a precursor to my next goal of cloning 10 different websites, APIs, or projects. The aim of both of these projects together is to put me in a position to start making higher quality projects on my own.
